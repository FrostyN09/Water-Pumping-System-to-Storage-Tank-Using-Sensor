Project Overview:
This project involves building an automated water pumping system that fills a storage tank based on water level readings from a sensor. The system ensures that the tank is always filled with water without manual intervention. When the water level drops below a certain threshold, the pump turns on automatically and stops when the tank is full.

Components Required:
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP8266) – to control the pump and read sensor data.
Water Level Sensor (e.g., Ultrasonic or Float Sensor) – to measure the water level inside the tank.
Water Pump – to move water into the storage tank.
Relay Module – to control the water pump on/off through the microcontroller.
Power Supply – to power the pump and microcontroller.
Wiring and connectors – for connecting the components.
Buzzer/Indicator Light (optional) – to notify the user when the tank is full or empty.

Working Principle:
Water Level Monitoring: The water level sensor continuously measures the water level inside the tank.
Pump Activation: When the water level falls below a predefined minimum threshold (low-level sensor reading), the microcontroller sends a signal to the relay module to turn on the water pump.
Pump Deactivation: Once the water reaches the maximum level (high-level sensor reading), the microcontroller deactivates the relay, which turns off the pump.
Safety Features: You can add safety features such as turning off the pump if no water is detected at the pump inlet to prevent damage.


Steps to Implement:
Hardware Setup:
Connect the water level sensor to the microcontroller to monitor the tank's water level.
Connect the water pump to a relay, and then connect the relay to the microcontroller to control pump operations.
Optionally, connect a buzzer or indicator to notify when the tank is full.
Software Setup:
Write the code to continuously read the sensor data.
Compare the water level reading with the predefined thresholds.
Use the relay to control the pump based on the water level.
Add notifications or alerts if required.


Advantages of the System:
Automation: Reduces the need for manual intervention in water management.
Water Conservation: Prevents water overflow by stopping the pump when the tank is full.
Energy Efficiency: The pump only runs when necessary, saving energy.


Conclusion:
This project provides an efficient solution for automatically filling a storage tank using a water pump controlled by sensor data. It can be further enhanced by adding Wi-Fi capabilities for remote monitoring and control, or even integrating solar power for sustainability.
